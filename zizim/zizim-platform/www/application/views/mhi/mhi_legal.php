				<h4>General Description</h4>

				<p>Welcome to Crowdmap. Crowdmap hosts maps created by users using the <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> platform (the "Services"), through our website available at <a href="http://www.crowdmap.com">http://www.crowdmap.com</a> (the "Site"). Each map displays crowdsourced location and information data generated by users.  By way of example, a user might create a map using Crowdmap and the Ushahidi platform to present location and information data about where emergency services are needed during a natural disaster.</p>

				<p>To provide the Services, we have to set out some ground rules for using the Site in this document (the "Terms"). By accessing, using, or contributing to the Services or the Site, and in consideration for the Services we provide to you, you agree to abide by the Terms.</p>
