<p>Zizim is a field guide to remarkable plants and gardens. A valuable tool
for a patabotanical field worker, it allows you to assemble and explore
a growing collection of urban plants amenable to live with humans and
gardens where people cultivate, contemplate, exchange and eat plants.</p><br/>

<p>Please peruse this field guide in your neighbourhood and further afield.
Your contributions will be of utmost value to observation and experience
of human-plant interactions in the city.</p><br/>
